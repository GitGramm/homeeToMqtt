# homeeToMqtt
Bidirectional Interface between homee and MQTT, which allows you to read and set states of device types managed in the Smart Home Gateway "homee" (https://hom.ee). 

## Info
This tool is still in alpha state.
The source is based on parts from following github projects:

* stfnhmplr/homebridge-homee
* stfnhmplr/node-red-contrib-homee

## Disclaimer
This tool uses a non official API from Codeatelier GmbH for the Smart Home Gateway "homee", which is subject to change at all times.

## Idea
This tool publish state changes of homee to MQTT and subcribes topics to change state of OnOff switches via MQTT.

MQTT messages are easily to subscribe in Node-Red, Homebridge, Hass.io or other gateways with MQTT clients.

## Installation
Just clone the repository (via git clone URL of this project) and change to the directory of the cloned repository.
Install all dependencies with:

    npm i

and run with:

    node app.js
    
You can optionally use the install scripts in the "rasperry" directory to either install homeeToMQTT and/or install the needed MQTT broker/server (Mosquito) on a RaspBerry PI. Adapt the UserNames and the hostnames in the file itself or change later on in the config.json described below.

## config.json
homeeToMqtt looks for config.json in following order:
 - actual directory
 - /etc/homeeToMqtt
 - installed directory

Create a config.json in the desired folder as the app and adjust it to your needs

    {
        # use your username (adding an own user for MQTT is a good idea)
        "homeeUserName": "mqtt",
        # use the password of the above user
        "homeePassword": "mqtt",
        # use the hostname or IP of your homee here, ensure it has a static IP oif IP-adress is used
        "homeeServer": "homee.fritz.box",
        # use the hostname or IP of your MQTT server/broker here (might also be localhost if on the same machine)
        "mqttServer": "matt.fritz.box",
        # Use the defined user name for the MQTT server in use (might be left blank "" if no username is set)
        "mqttUserName": "mqtt",
        # use the password for the defined user for the MQTT server in use (leave blank "" if no username/pw is set)
        "mqttPassword": "mqtt",
        # publish homee states to mqtt as json, leave as is, unless you know better
        "publish": true,
        # publish homee states to mqtt as single int value, leave as is, unless you know better
        "publishInt": false,
        # publish homee states to mqtt as boolen string value (True,False), leave as is, unless you know better
        "publishBool": true,
        # subscribe to mqtt topics, leave as is, unless you know better
        "subscribe": true,
        # request full homee states every status timer seconds
        "homeeStatusRepeat": true,
        "statusTimer": 180
    }
